# Qiskit-Global-Summer-School-Submissions
Recently participated in IBM's Qiskit Global Summer School. I finished all 4 labs (+ lab 0) and want to share my submissions on my GitHub Repository. I received the Quantum Excellence badge, and I hope to be able to learn more about the quantum world!

I got a bit of help from the official Discord, Google, and ChatGPT, but it was fun to be completely lost amidst the classes! Of course, what I made isn't perfect, but it would be cool to present my very first attempt at understanding Quantum mechanics. If you have any advice on how I can improve, feel free to contact me... somehow...
